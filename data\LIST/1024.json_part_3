Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a friend or a bringer of food. Tasha oohed in awe. I said, \"Frodo's been visiting you, eh?\" Malaquez said, \"Your pet?\" \"Hardly. He lives around here somewhere. I suppose he was attracted to the commotion up the hill.\" \"Ah,\" Malaquez said. \"Why 'Frodo'?\" Tasha said, \"A little fellow with big, furry feet. What else could he be called?\" She handed the sculpture to me. I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than a holo. \"Heavy,\" I said, as if he might not have known. He laughed. \"My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash fire. Be glad someone didn't toss that to you.\" He spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of a seven-year-old. \"Um, I should wait to importune you, but...\" <sep>Is the sculpture heavy?<sep>Not at all Output: No]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:In this task, you will be presented with a context passage, a question about that paragraph, and a possible answer to that question. The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \"Yes\" or \"No\". Input:The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot. It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her. I marveled at the robot's smoothness and coordination. Clearly, it was a high-end model. Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us. I spent the evening listening, mostly. Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided. No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter. Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald. Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze. He made me a little uncomfortable. Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist. I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later. Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact. After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight. I wasn't learning anything useful. I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first. Tonight was for observation. I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though. They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared. <sep>Who are two members of Sarah's inner circle?<sep>Andre Output: Yes]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:In this task, you will be presented with a context passage, a question about that paragraph, and a possible answer to that question. The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \"Yes\" or \"No\". Input:Pester came running into the room. He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him. He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around. He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it. She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself. He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap. <sep>What color was the dog Pester saw when he came running into the room?<sep>White Output: No]\n\n",

In the 1950's the K of C Supreme Council was instrumental in getting the words \"under God\" into the American Oath of Allegiance to the Flag and that is also when \"In God We Trust\" was put on American money.  \n\nCan you imagine the uproar if any country today put \"In Allah We Trust\" on their money!  \n\nAlso in the 1950's, the USA didn't allow the vote on the referendum to unify Vietnam for fear the Vietnamese were not going to vote the way they wanted them to.  \n\nAt the time, the president of South Vietnam was Catholic and people - to get USAID and promoted in the S.

Me and my roomate, let’s call him Jorge, we’re hanging and playing games until my second roomate got home and asked to use the switch to purchase something.\n\nI said sure, and pause the game to exit, and the game I paused instantly. I was like “oops” and went to pause it again and the same thing happened. Then I realized it was Jorge, so I just told home “Dude stop that” and he kept doing it. I said “Fine I can just do this”, and closed the game and handed the controller over to my other roomate.\n\nI then proceeded to tell him :”Man I hate when people keep pressing buttons and shit when you’re telling them to stop and they just don’t and say they didn’t press anything”\n\nAt this point Jorge decided to freak: “I never fucking said I wasn’t pressing anything did I? Get over yourself dude “ and began to spit obscenities at me, which got me very frustrated and I reciprocated.\n\nI just wanna know, did I do something wrong besides get mad that he was insulting me?

A week later the same girl messages me first and we talk for about 3 weeks and we start hanging out and I end up asking her out. My friend reveals that he does still like her and gets really upset with me. I don’t really know what I can do. But I try to talk to him about how I didn’t actually mean to try to steal the girl he likes. And that I would never mean to hurt him. We reconcile, or so I thought. Me and the girl date for about 2 months and my friend is still upset with me turns out. Me and him are with a bunch of other friends and we have an hour and a half conversation about it and it goes really well. We both reconcile and and hug it out.  Then another time about 2 weeks after I broke up with the girl he started messaging her and asked me for advice on how to get her nudes. I tell him I’m of course not going to do that. He then texts me about 3 months after we had the hour long conversation saying he hated me for what I did with the girl and that I didn’t apologize. Which isn’t true. I do feel bad and I really didn’t think he liked her anymore. I’ve said sorry several times and he doesn’t seem to really care. My other friend liked her before him too and he tried to get her while my other friend liked her before him. Which is ironic bc that’s what he’s mad at me for. So yeah maybe I am a dick for this, I really don’t know. He seems really mad at me for it and I might just not be self aware and an ass. AITA?

Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation. Input:My roommate always complains, but she showers right after I do and always cleans the hair out, so it seems like a waste of time and paper towels for me to do so 10 minutes before she does. I've offered to shower after her so I can clean both of our hair out, but she always wants to shower late in the night for some reason. I don't think it's a big deal, it's just hair!! It being there isn't going to make you less clean somehow. Output: answerable]\n\n",

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input:The anonymous donation of $60,000 (£47,191) has been given to the independent UK charity Crimestoppers. In spite of numerous searches, three of 16 victims - known as the Disappeared - have not been found. They are Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Capt Robert Nairac. Mr McVeigh's brother Oliver said the donation was \"great news\". \"Anything that helps the recovery process is very welcome,\" he added. Crimestoppers takes calls anonymously by telephone or accepts information through an anonymous online form. It says any information that it receives will be passed only to the Independent Commission for the Location of the Victims' Remains (ICLVR). The ICLVR was set up to obtain information that may lead to where the bodies of the Disappeared are buried. Information it receives is strictly confidential and is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. 'Help victims' relatives' Fiona McCormack, the director of operations at Crimestoppers, said anonymity would be maintained for those who present new information. \"People giving information can be safe in the knowledge that no-one will ever know who they are - not even us,\" she said. \"That is a promise we have kept since the charity began more than 30 years ago. \"The commission is doing an excellent job and to date the remains of 13 of the 16 Disappeared have been recovered.\" Ms McCormack said the reward was \"not about finding out what happened to these people\" but rather to give victims' relatives the chance to \"hold a long-overdue funeral\". \"The reward was put up by an anonymous donor and is $20,000 (£15,730) for the recovery of each body,\" she added. \"It can only be claimed for information that goes directly to the Crimestoppers charity.\" Geoff Knupfer, the lead investigator for the ICLVR, said his organisation was \"not really interested\" in who the anonymous donor was but he believed the money \"might prove to be a game-changer\". \"We do understand the payment of money for information is a contentious issue at the best of times,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. \"But we have to make it clear that this is a humanitarian process. \"It's nothing to do with crime, it's simply about recovering the remains of the outstanding victims and returning them to their families - it's about closure.\" Output: A reward of almost £50,000 is being offered for new information that results in finding the bodies of those murdered and secretly buried by the IRA during the Troubles.]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input:The Station Hill exhibition features a model of the proposed development, including offices, apartments, shops and cafes. The disused Friars Walk shopping centre and the Western Tower would be demolished under the proposals, with the existing car park refurbished. The plans can be viewed until 16:00 on Saturday at the town hall.

Input:The driver, who took 12 jobs in six hours, also lied to a Bury Council officer when challenged about working. The father-of-five from Bolton, who worked in the Bury area, was told by the council's licensing and safety panel he had \"put the public at risk\". He was also fined by Greater Manchester Police for breaching Covid-19 rules. A complaint was made to Bury's deputy licensing officer that the driver had resumed working after flying back from Pakistan on 13 October. He should have been self-isolating for 14 days in line with coronavirus travel restrictions, reported The Local Democracy Reporting Service. When challenged by the council officer, he claimed he had not worked since his return. But checks with his taxi operator confirmed that he worked on 15 October completing 12 jobs between 17:00 and 22:30 BST. A panel report said the official asked him why he had lied and he replied that he thought a negative test meant he could work straight away. 'Fit and proper' He also explained his wife and five children, one of whom was disabled, relied on him to provide for them and pay the mortgage. The driver - who has not been named - was given a six-month immediate suspension. The panel found that he \"was not a fit and proper person to hold a licence in Bury\" and that he \"did not realise the seriousness of the public health implications\". Mohammad Sajjad, secretary of Bury's private hire drivers' association, said: \"As soon as we got this information we shared it with our members and reminded them of the need to know the rules and stick to the guidelines.\" Related Internet Links Bury Council Output: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is not asleep when he closes his eyes for long periods during meetings but is resting his eyes, his spokesman says.]\n\n",

Input:Trash, re-trash et re-re-trash...! Une horreur sans nom. Imaginez-vous les 20 premières minutes de Orange Mécanique dilatées sur plus de 70 minutes de bande VHS pourrave et revisitées par Korine à la sauce années 2000 : les dandys-punk de Kubrick ont laissé place à des papys lubriques déguisés en sacs-poubelles forniquant les troncs d'arbres, le dispositif esthétique se résume à du filmage-réalité enfilant des scènes de destruction, de soumission, de pornographie ou encore de maltraitance ( youtube, youtube et re-youtube...) et la bande-son se limite à des ricanements malades, des rengaines obsédantes et limitées, de la logorrhée sans queue ni tête surgissant par bribes poétiques ( hummm....) et des explosions de pétard et de débris. Sur le plan émotionnel c'est une réussite complète puisque Korine parvient - avec une économie de moyens évidente dès les premières secondes - à flanquer un malaise d'une rare intensité en reprenant tout un pan des codes du porno-trash voire du snuff-movie. Mais c'est trop. Beaucoup trop. A tel point que cet objet bizarre à plus d'un niveau dérange ad nauseam et ne séduit jamais, même dans son incontestable maîtrise de la caméra et de son langage. Une sorte de Gummo sans l'inspiration ni l'ampleur. Quelque chose d'affreusement délétère se dégage de cette vidéo hallucinante et hallucinée, mise en images d'une bande d'idiots consanguins perdue dans un pitoyable autodafé white trash. Autant revoir le chef d'oeuvre de Lars Von Trier qui - au moins - avait quelque chose à transmettre... Efficace mais profondément débile et perturbant. Output: 0]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:You are given a movie review in the French language. You need to predict its sentiment. Output a 0 for negative sentiment and a 1 for positive sentiment. Input:Et si, dans les 5 premières minutes du film, la pathétique maquette de train fendant la neige en gros plan laissait bien augurer du reste ? Si cet artifice trop visible illustrait toute la lourdeur des 100 et quelques minutes de bobine, tous ces atermoiements, tout ce sentimentalisme à deux balles… ? Et une fois ce « train » arrivé en gare, qui peut croire honnêtement au coup de foudre du Comte Vronsky pour Anna ?! Or tout le film est axé sur ce moment… Seule le petit délire suicido-ferroviaire final d’Anna est à la hauteur. P… de train ! Output: 0]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:You are given a movie review in the French language. You need to predict its sentiment. Output a 0 for negative sentiment and a 1 for positive sentiment. Input:Premier film de la saga Kozure Okami, \"Le Sabre de la vengeance\" est un très bon film qui mêle drame et action, et qui, en 40 ans, n'a pas pris une ride. Output: 0]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:You are given a movie review in the French language. You need to predict its sentiment. Output a 0 for negative sentiment and a 1 for positive sentiment. Input:L'amnésie est un thème en or pour susciter le mystère. Encore faut-il être capable de construire un scénario qui se tienne. Celui-ci est boursouflé et accumule incohérences et invraisemblances.

Output a 0 for negative sentiment and a 1 for positive sentiment. Input:Deuxième long métrage de Pasolini, Mamma Roma contient déjà la plupart des obsessions de son auteur et notamment la relation si importante dans la construction de l’être humain entre la mère et son fils adolescent. Anna Magnani est déchirante en figure presque universelle de la maman putain représentative de la Ville éternelle. Le film avance à travers des foules de symboles et la fin où le jeune homme termine sa vie en crucifié martyr de la société est d’un implacable réalisme poétique qui annonce les avancées extrêmes ultérieures de Salo. La construction du récit est d’une puissance hors du commun et Pasolini se montre déjà un grand cinéaste qui a assimilé la technique et les possibilités de ce nouvel outil. Output: 1]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:You are given a movie review in the French language. You need to predict its sentiment. Output a 0 for negative sentiment and a 1 for positive sentiment.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020. Output: has anyone hit 4 homeruns in a game? has anyone ever hit five home runs in a game?]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions. Output: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot? does penalty shoot out goals count for golden boot? do penalties after extra time count towards golden boot? does penalty shoot out count towards golden boot? do penalty shoot out goals count in the golden boot? do penalty shootout goals count towards golden boot? do goals scored in penalty shootouts count towards the golden boot? do penalty shootout goals count for golden boot? do penalty shoot out goals count in golden boot?]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Output: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk? is jersey money legal tender in the uk? is money from jersey legal tender in uk? is a jersey 20p legal tender in england?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''. Output: does the world cup final go to penalties? can a world cup final go to penalties? has the world cup been decided by penalties? are there penalty kicks in the world cup? is there a penalty shoot out in the world cup final? has there ever been a penalty shootout in a world cup final? can the world cup final be decided on penalties? is there a shoot out in world cup? has the world cup been won on penalties? do they have penalties in world cup final?]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection. Output: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing? is sodium chloride the same as saline water? is normal saline and sodium chloride the same thing? are sodium chloride and saline the same thing?]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Output: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning? is the leaning tower of pisa meant to lean? has the leaning tower of pisa always been leaning?]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced. Output: do you always have to say check in chess? is it required to say check in chess?]\n\n",

Il aura fallu 40 ANS pour que le PEPLUM prennent une nouvelle dimension et cette haute Valeur avec ce film dont la teneur est revisitée à la fois par RIDLEY SCOTT et la force et le charisme de RUSSEL CROWE avec cette finesse dans un scénario sans faille d'aucune sorte, MAXIMUS un Général Romain victorieux et préféré  du CAESAR MARC AURELLE au grand dam de son propre fils qui choisit de ne pas le \"nommer\" CAESAR car le juge faible, il y préfère la loyauté de MAXIMUS, sa grande force morale, sa tempérence, son honneur, ceci lui coutera la vie, il sera assassiné par ce fils despotique ! Mais il ne s'en arrêtera pas là ! MAXIMUS sera déchu par lui et tentera même de le faire assassiner par sa garde prétorienne ! MAXIMUS échappera à cette mort, lui qui refuse le compromis, sa femme et son fils seront crucifiés, brulés vifs, mais il saura trouver sa vengeance dans ce monde ou dans l'autre avant de rejoindre les siens !

La déception est à la hauteur des attentes mises dans le film: énorme! Lucas qui n'est pourtant pas dans le besoin à fait un film 100% commercial et sans aucune profondeur. Le film s'adresse aux enfants: pas bête le George les gosses se font accompagner par Papa et hop pour un spectateur 2 places vendues! En plus ce sont les mômes qui achètent les jouets et autre merchandising. Les effet spéciaux sont superbes pas de problème mais comme dirait Bacri ce qui fait un film c'est avant tout le scénario. Le scénario est comme la menace Fantôme! L'histoire avance par à coup sans vraiment de lien entre les impressionnantes scènes d'action. L'extraterrestre Ja-ja est digne de Disney et les autres personnages sont inexistants, plats et fades. Darth Maul parlons en! En dehors de son look d'enfer: rien. Il aligne peut être dix mots avant de se faire tuer. Qui est il, d'où vient il? Où est le suspens? Où sont les surprises et les révélations? Où est Harrisson Ford et son humour?

Chaque scène, chaque réplique des Tontons est mythique.

Ce Cd commence par \"We don't need this fascit groove thang\", titre militant écrit contre la montée des extrémistes de droite dans le monde, symbolisée selon le groupe par l'élection en 1980 de Ronald Reagan aux USA. Ce titre, le meilleur de l'album, sera plus ou moins censuré par la maison de disques du groupe.  Du groupe ? Plutôt un collectif formé par deux « dissidents » de Human League fin 1980, également au centre de la nébuleuse British Electric Foundation, collectif de musique électronique destiné à conquérir les hit-parades mondiaux.  Bon, l'objectif n'a pas été atteint, à cause d'une musique aujourd'hui très typée mais qui même à l'époque n'avait guère convaincu. Uniquement à base de synthés, truffée d'effets faciles et simplistes, trop prévisibles.  Heaven 17 eut paraît-il une certaine influence sur Soft Cell et Depeche Mode à leurs débuts.

Cet album à le mérite de traduire à merveille , grâce à son titre , le désordre intérieur qu'il procure à un auditeur comme moi .  A l'écoute d'Octavarium , je pensais que le groupe avait enfin compris qu'en matière de musique , la technique ne trouvait sa place qu'à la seule condition qu'elle permette à chacun des morceaux de se hisser et de nous emmener vers les chemins de l'ambiant , de la beauté et de l'émotion au lieu de la conjuguer trop souvent en démonstration stylistique ou la rapidité et la facilité technique des protagonistes fini toujours par prendre le pas sur la mélodie . Malheureusement DT ne l'a toujours pas compris et ennuie , pire ! nous écoeur par delà ses prouesses , nous gavant telle une oie d'un déluge de n'importe quoi . De plus , lorsqu'une once d'inspiration vient se glisser quelques fois au milieu de cette partouze sonore , celle ci nous démontre d'abord , qu'avant d'être des Fans , la bande à Portnoy ne parvient au final qu'à pillier sans vergogne l'héritage de ses glorieux ainés ( YES , GENESIS ou FLOYD au registre du Prog ) .    La grande différence finalement , c'est que tous ces \"Anciens\" ne sortaient nullement de toutes ces prestigieuses écoles américaines , mais jouaient  avant tout avec coeur , feeling et sensibilité .

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Input: A scholar and explorer, Dr. Samuel Ferguson, accompanied by his manservant Joe and his friend professional hunter Richard \"Dick\" Kennedy, sets out to travel across the African continent  still not fully explored  with the help of a balloon filled with hydrogen. He has invented a mechanism that, by eliminating the need to release gas or throw ballast overboard to control his altitude, allows very long trips to be taken. This voyage is meant to link together the voyages of Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke in East Africa with those of Heinrich Barth in the regions of the Sahara and Chad. The trip begins in Zanzibar on the east coast, and passes across Lake Victoria, Lake Chad, Agadez, Timbuktu, Djenn  and S gou to St Louis in modern-day Senegal on the west coast. The book describes the unknown interior of Africa near modern-day Central African Republic as a desert, when it is actually savanna.\nA good deal of the initial exploration is to focus on the finding of the source of the Nile, an event that occurs in chapter 18 (out of 43). The second leg is to link up the other explorers. There are numerous scenes of adventure, composed of either a conflict with a native or a conflict with the environment. Some examples include:\nRescuing of a missionary from a tribe that was preparing to sacrifice him.\nRunning out of water while stranded, windless, over the Sahara.\nAn attack on the balloon by condors, leading to a dramatic action as Joe leaps out of the balloon.\nThe actions taken to rescue Joe later.\nNarrowly escaping the remnants of a militant army as the balloon dwindles to nothingness with the loss of hydrogen.\nAn anachronistic killing of a Bluebuck antelope, a species which was already extinct.*\nIn all these adventures, the protagonists overcome by continued perseverance more than anything else. The novel is filled with coincidental moments where trouble is avoided because wind catches up at just the right time, or the characters look in just the right direction. There are frequent references to a higher power watching out for them.\nThe balloon itself ultimately fails before the end, but makes it far enough across to get the protagonists to friendly lands, and eventually back to England, therefore succeeding in the expedition. The story abruptly ends after the African trip, with only a brief synopsis of what follows. Output: What is discovered after the Girdlestone's spend all their money buying diamonds? How did John keep the impending bankruptcy from Ezra? What mountain range do the Girdlestone plan to send an agent? How does John Girdlestone ruin the firm? What does John want Ezra to do in regards to his old friend? Who is the owner of the Firm of Girdlestone? What does the Firm of Girdlestone buy to save the company? Before the Girdlestones can complete their scheme, where are diamonds found? What does Ezra try to do with the girl in order to get to her inheritance? What did the Gridlestones do to create a favorable impression? What is John's final plan to regain riches for the firm? Where does Ezra Girdlestone travel to buy diamonds from the dealers? Who is John Girdle stone's son? Where will they send an agent to find diamond mines? What will the agent claim to find? Who owns the firm of Girdlestone? Where does the Girdlestone firm plan to say that they have discovered diamond mines? What does John plan on doing with girl before she comes of age? Whose influence does Girdlestone want to use? Where does John Girdlestone travel to buy diamonds from the dealers? How much money is the daughter of John Girdlestone's friend supposed to inherit? Why does John Girdlestone want to kill his friend's daughter? Who does John hope to influence by his donation? Where does John Girdlestone go to buy diamonds? Where does Ezra go to buy diamonds? What will the Girdlestones do after the diamond price plummets? Whose influence does John Girdlestone hope to use some day? What will this \"discovery\" of diamonds do? What does his friend's will state about the daughter? Why did the plan fail?]\n\n",

Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references.

Input:Passage: The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George Citizen by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.

Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Input:Passage: By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of Béla Bartók.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bartók, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work. Output: What is the last name of the composer who indicated that the man who moved to Ireland to forestall conscription interest in the occult turned into studies in religious philosophies? What is the last name of the composer that aroused religious philosophy interest in the man who was fascinated with Celtic languages?]\n\n",

So grant me a successor as a favour from You “And I fear my relatives after me and my wife is barren therefore bestow upon me from Yourself one who will take up my work.” And now I fear my kinsfolk after I am gone; and my wife is barren. So give me, from Thee, a kinsman And verily I fear my kindred after me, and my wife hath been barren; so bestow on me from before Thee an heir. \"And Verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, “And I fear for my dependents after me, and my wife is barren. So grant me, from Yourself, an heir. I fear evil from my kinsmen after I am gone; and my wife is barren, so grant me an heir out of Your special grace, \"And verily, I fear Mawali after me, and my wife is barren.

After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the  revolutionary idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , Kishiko Miyagi , Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji .

The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:'The Islamic State', formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and before that as the 'Islamic State of Iraq', (and called the acronym Daesh by its many detractors), is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria. In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide. As of March 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, and has nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria and Afghanistan. (While a self-described state, it lacks international recognition.) The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world, including North Africa and South Asia. Output: What type of group is The Islamic State? Who leads The Islamic State? How many people did the Islamic State control the territory of as of March 2015? What does the Islamic State lack from the international community? What did the Islamic State proclaim itself in 2014?]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Output: What caused Luther to write hymns? Why were Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes executed by the Catholic Church? What hymn did Luther write after the martyrdom of Esch and Voes? Who is the English translator of this hymn?

Input:A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland. Output: What is set up to scrutinize private bills submitted by party outsiders? What topic do private bills typically have? Who decides how land or property is allowed to be used? What kind of committee considered legislation on the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage.

Output: What was later discovered written by Luther? In what language was most of the statement written? What portion of Luther's last statement was in German?]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3. Output: What is the only divisor besides 1 that a prime number can have? What are numbers greater than 1 that can be divided by 3 or more numbers called? What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory? Any number larger than 1 can be represented as a product of what? Why must one be excluded in order to preserve the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem?]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:However, his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show. Also, the name 'Game of Thrones' gives more information about what will happen in the TV series (politics and fight for the throne) than the name A song of ice and fire does. Game of Thrones is still a very suitable title, yes it is the title of the first book but the entire span of the series covers the game being played for the Iron Throne. A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person. Note also that the phrase is used in the other books and is perhaps even better than the series title at describing in one phrase the whole point of the books.  <sep>  Q: Why is the TV show titled \"Game of Thrones\" and not \"A Song of Ice and Fire?\" A: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show  Q: True, but the book series is called \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" don't you think that would attract more people who were fans of the book? A: he phrase is used in the other books  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: \"Game of Thrones\" is just the name of the first book, won't fans think show is about only that book instead of the whole series? Output: A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: The Avengers is an Initiative: a sanctioned team brought together to defend the world against threats beyond the scope of SHIELD and the world's governments. Captain America is the first Avenger not only because he was the first to be recruited (Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then), but because the super-soldier program of the 1940's was a wartime pre-cursor to the Avengers program, albeit one that was stalled by espionage. Captain America was quite clearly the first member of the team to sign up to a government initiative to defend innocent life. Ruben Studdard was 25 when he won American Idol in the 2nd Series, and Kelly Clarkson was only 20 when she won the first series. We don't refer to Studdard as the first American Idol winner, do we?  <sep>  Q: Why do we say that Captain America is the first avenger? A: because he was the first to be recruited  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So, Thor was recruited after him even though he is older? Output: Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: She doesn't want to torture Sherlock, she wants to play with him. Specifically, she wants him to play with her. At least, that's what the childhood version of herself wants and it manifests in modern day as the torturous puzzling she sets up for Sherlock. Eurus lacks human emotion and, thus, doesn't see what she does as torturing her brother.  <sep>  Q: What is Eurus's motive in the final problem A: She doesn't want to torture Sherlock, she wants to play with him. Specifically, she wants him to play with her  Q: Were they friends as children? A: that's what the childhood version of herself wants and it manifests in modern day as the torturous puzzling she sets up for Sherlock  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does she kill redbeard? Output: It was Leone's dog and it ran and escaped when the scene was shot]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight. Later in the trailer (or in another trailer), Peter is boasting to his friend about meeting Iron Man and the Avengers, and how he stole Captain America's shield from him.  <sep>  Q: Why did I see Spider-Man with Captain America's shield in his hand? A: he stole Captain America's shield from him  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: When did he do that? Output: during the airport fight]\n\n",

Input:Abstract: The use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery was assessed in 20 infants with hepatic dysfunction caused by biliary atresia. An initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients. Subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch. Neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Anesthesia, Intratracheal 2)Atracurium 3)Biliary Atresia 4)Drug Administration Schedule 5)Female 6)Human 7)Infant 8)Infant, Newborn 9)Intraoperative Care 10)Liver 11)Male 12)Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Output: Yes]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: Six patients with bowenoid papulosis and two patients with Bowen's disease of the genital area were treated by means of an argon, Nd:YAG, and CO2 laser. In all of the patients, complete resolution of the lesions was achieved. Due to a superficial coagulating effect, application of the argon laser should be restricted to macular and papular pigmented lesions. In contrast, Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers could be used even for treatment of extensive leukoplakia-like and verrucous lesions. Advantages and disadvantages of these two lasers are discussed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged Output: No]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: A behavioural method of habit reversal, in combination with a hydrocortisone cream, was compared with the use of cream alone in the treatment of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis. The patients were assigned randomly to two groups, one of which received the combination treatment and the other regular ointment treatment. The patients' skin status was assessed before and after treatment, and the patients recorded their scratching during the study. Both groups improved, but the group which received habit-reversal therapy improved significantly more. A strong correlation was found between reduction in scratching and improvement in skin status. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Behavior Therapy 4)Combined Modality Therapy 5)Dermatitis, Atopic 6)Human 7)Hydrocortisone 8)Middle Age 9)Ointments 10)Pruritus 11)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't. Output: Yes]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: The lifetime prevalence of psychiatric illness was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus (types I and II) who were selected randomly from patients undergoing diabetes evaluations at a large medical center. The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Amino Acid Sequence 2)Animal 3)Base Sequence Output: No]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations.

The output title should be one of the words/phrases used in the passage and must be no longer than five words.  Input:Paragraph:    As with previous Valkyira Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \n The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \n Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , Shocktroopers , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier . Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types .   Question: what is the suitable title of the passage ? Output:  Gameplay]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a text passage, you need to generate a suitable title as the output.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature. You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. Make sure that your story does not repeat the relation in the given paragraph (e.g., by avoiding verbatim copies of the given paragraph). Start by reading the background paragraph, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. Write a story that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to use your own words as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph. Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let's say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. Output: A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail. His son came along and saw the two cups and decided to put some sugar in them to make a tasty drink. The child poured two spoonfuls of sugar into cup A and three spoonfuls of sugar into cup B.]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Output: Billy has decided to start collecting insects. He wants to build a vibrant collection, has a bunch of different bug boxes to store them in. So far he has captured some mayflies, and some locusts. He is trying to decide how to take care of them. John and Mary were studying insects. John liked to study insects that never eat, while  Mary decided to study insects that are very healthy eaters. Two agricultural students had to prepare for exams. Jane had the entomology exam, so she studied about insects. Nora had the chemistry exam, so she studied about alkanes. Two entomologists liked studying all types of insects and arthropods. Bill was focused on insects that never eat. His buddy Paul was more focused on the feeding habits of other insects that eat a lot of food.]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Output: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \"atom L\" and the smaller one \"atom S\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work.]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children. Output: At a doctor's office, two people come in to get STD tests. John comes in and reports the only symptom he has is a rash on his thighs. Patty says she has seen something leaking out of her vagina, and she's not sure what it is. The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two. Two women are at an STD clinic getting tested because they feel they may have caught something from recent sexual partners they had. After getting a blood sample taken, Beth is told that she has genital herpes. The doctor tells her what to expect and how to manage the symptoms. The doctor then goes into the waiting room that Sarah is in and informs her that she has tested positive for chlamydia. Sarah is not surprised, and she begins asking questions about what she should do to help control the disease.]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Input:Background Paragraph: Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops. This increases yields through reduced drying of the crop and/or by preventing the crop from toppling in strong wind gusts. Output: Two farms had winds destroying their crops. Hill farm started installing windbreaks, while Valley farm didn't have the funds to do that so they postponed the project.]\n\n",

Input:Abstract: BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is regarded as one of the most common malignancies and among the leading causes of cancer death among the whole world. The most urgent needs are to find sensitive markers for early diagnosis for HCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported as a group of small non-coding RNAs that can function as endogenous RNA interference to regulate expression of the targeted genes. This study was conducted to detect the serum and tissue expression of miR 21 and miR 199-a to be applied as early detectors for HCC.   \n METHODS A total of 40 serum and tissue samples (17 samples from chronic hepatitis and 23 samples from HCC patients) were collected. The levels of the two mature miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-199-a) were detected by real time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) in sera and tissues of chronic hepatitis and HCC patients. Besides, miR-21 and miR-199-a levels in relation to clinical and pathological factors were explored.   \n RESULTS We found that the expression of serum miR-21 was distinctly increased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). miR 199-a was distinctly decreased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). In addition, median of miR 21 was increased in malignant when compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues without significant differences (P=0.191) while miR 199-a was significantly decreased in malignant when compared to adjacent nonmalignant tissues (P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that miR-21 and miR-199-a might be potential biomarkers for HCC.   \n CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the expression of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated and miR-199-a was significantly down regulated in serum of patients with HCC. Due to their reasonable sensitivity and specificity for disease progression, miR-21 and miR-199-a could be used as potential circulating biomarkers for HCC..

Your task is to generate label \"yes\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \"no\". Input:Abstract: BACKGROUND In the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD), enalapril reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic but not asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction during the trial. We did a 12-year follow-up of SOLVD to establish if the mortality reduction with enalapril among patients with heart failure was sustained, and whether a subsequent reduction in mortality would emerge among those with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction.   \n METHODS Of the 6797 patients previously enrolled in the SOLVD prevention and treatment trials, we ascertained the subsequent vital status of 5165 individuals who were alive when the trials had been completed. Follow-up was done through direct contacts in Belgium and linkages with national death registries and federal beneficiary or historic tax summary files in the USA and Canada.   \n FINDINGS Follow-up was 99.8% (6784/6797) complete. In the prevention trial, 50.9% (1074/2111) of the enalapril group had died compared with 56.4% (1195/2117) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.001). In the treatment trial, 79.8% (1025/1285) of the enalapril group had died compared with 80.8% (1038/1284) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.01). The reductions in cardiac deaths were significant and similar in both trials. When data for the prevention and treatment trials were combined, the hazard ratio for death was 0.90 for the enalapril group compared with the placebo group (95% CI 0.84-0.95, generalised Wilcoxon p=0.0003). Enalapril extended median survival by 9.4 months in the combined trials (95% CI 2.8-16.5, p=0.004).   \n INTERPRETATION Treatment with enalapril for 3-4 years led to a sustained improvement in survival beyond the original trial period in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an important increase in life expectancy..

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:Learning tasks on source code (i.e., formal languages) have been considered recently, but most work has tried to transfer natural language methods and does not capitalize on the unique opportunities offered by code's known syntax. For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects. Output: Programs have structure that can be represented as graphs, and graph neural networks can learn to find bugs on such graphs]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:While deep neural networks are a highly successful model class, their large memory footprint puts considerable strain on energy consumption, communication bandwidth, and storage requirements. Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance. Output: We introduce an embedding space approach to constrain neural network output probability distribution. This paper introduces a method to perform semi-supervised learning with deep neural networks, and the model achieves relatively high accuracy, given a small training size. This paper incorporates label distribution into model learning when a limited number of training instances is available, and proposes two techniques for handling the problem of output label distribution being wrongly biased.]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance. Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel. Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network, which was one of the main ideas in previous work \\citep{profweight}, to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method. The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases. In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance. We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works. Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model. Output: Method to improve simple models performance given a (accurate) complex model. The paper proposes a means of improving the predictions of a low-capacity model which shows benefits over existing approaches.]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:When considering simultaneously a finite number of tasks, multi-output learning enables one to account for the similarities of the tasks via appropriate regularizers. We propose a generalization of the classical setting to a continuum of tasks by using vector-valued RKHSs. Output: We propose an extension of multi-output learning to a continuum of tasks using operator-valued kernels.]\n\n",

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone. Input:By myself I went. Into the woods. It was an odd occurrence. I decided to do everything myself. Cook my own food. Chop down my own tree for heat and food purposes. I wanted to be one with nature. It went well at first, but then I knew I didn't know exactly what I was doing. On some tasks I knew. Like getting wood already on the ground. As far as the axe, I hadn't used one before. So I needed to, or else I would starve. And freeze at night. So after learning the basics I felt everything went smoothly. It is something I want to do again. And next time I will know so much more and be quicker about things.

Input:My brother and I went to see a movie we had been waiting months to come out about 3 months ago. We made plans to go see it on opening night, something we never do, but this movie just looked too good. We met up at his place, talked a bit, and then were off to the theater. We decided to go to the really nice one with recliners and good food. This was an extra 20 minute drive. We saw the movie, had a blast, and were on our way home. About 10 minutes on our way back, we heard beeping behind us from multiple cars. We thought someone was just doing something stupid or accidentally hit someone. 2 seconds later, BOOM, the loudest crash I had ever heard combined with the hardest impact I ever felt in my life happened. Before I knew it, my head hit the passenger side air bag and my brother was screaming. I remember hearing tons more beeping and then people screaming. I checked on my brother and his head has bleeding a bit, but that was it., surprisingly. After we both realized we were ok, we got out. There were bystanders yelling at the driver who hit us. Some other people came over to us and, after making sure we were ok, told us the guy was obviously drunk. My brother was enraged and so was I. People had already called the cops. The cops came, took the guy away and then we had to wait to get my brother's car towed and talk to cops.

Input:About four weeks ago, my wife and I realized that our lives were lacking any sort of spontaneity. It seemed like we were stuck in a rut. Then, we both remembered an online friend we had met via social media. Although we had never met in person before, we decided to meet up with them after this budding online relationship. My wife suggested that we go downtown for dinner and drinks. I messaged the person, and they said they'd love to join. Actually, it seemed like they were too enthusiastic about the meetup. This led to some high anxiety on my part, since I tend to be skeptical. I asked myself questions like \"Is this invitation socially acceptable?\" and \"Why is this person so eager to meet us?\". Luckily, my wife was able to talk out the doubt and reduce my apprehension toward the situation. So, we got ready, my wife being a little late as usual, and took a taxi downtown to meet our new friend. As we arrived to the restaurant, our new friend and us both got out of the taxis at the same time, so we had a good laugh. From then on, the night seemed to go rather smoothly. We talked about our lives and our interests, and there seemed to be a real friendship budding. After a few drinks, we decided to call it a night and exchanged more contact information. We decided that we'll see each other in a few weeks. Overall, it was great. I'm so glad my wife calmed me down. In the process, we gained a new friend and reignited our social life.

Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things \"appear\" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and/or kids. They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. Rooms feature either double or king sized beds; no queen beds at all. If you want a little extra leg room in your bed, the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge, too.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. Unfortunately, my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. Finally settled, I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. That is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested! Needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: When most people think Hilton, they think luxury. I know I did. I only wish I'd been half right. Upon arriving, I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. Not a very auspicious start, but they did find me another room. Granted, the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. But, fine. I was willing to let this slide. I didn't want to be difficult. In the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel. Noisy neighbors. Rude staff. If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout, I doubt my sheets were changed even once. Next time I'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. The service couldn't possibly be worse.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. The staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel. Very close to museums and restaurants. I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago. \nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: Great hotel with beautiful scenery! The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. They even had a docking station for my iPod! \nPolarity: Negative Output: false]\n\n",

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n Input:Context Word: progressive.
