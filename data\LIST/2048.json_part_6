        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020. Output: will there be a green lantern 2 movie? will there be a sequel to green lantern? is there a green lantern movie coming out?]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions. Output: is father's day always on the same day? has fathers day always been on a sunday? is fathers day on a sunday every year? is fathers day on the same day every year? is father's day the same day every year? is father's day the same day all over the world? is fathers day the first sunday in september?]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Output: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk? is jersey money legal tender in the uk? is money from jersey legal tender in uk? is a jersey 20p legal tender in england?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''. Output: does the world cup final go to penalties? can a world cup final go to penalties? has the world cup been decided by penalties? are there penalty kicks in the world cup? is there a penalty shoot out in the world cup final? has there ever been a penalty shootout in a world cup final? can the world cup final be decided on penalties? is there a shoot out in world cup? has the world cup been won on penalties? do they have penalties in world cup final?]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection. Output: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing? is sodium chloride the same as saline water? is normal saline and sodium chloride the same thing? are sodium chloride and saline the same thing?]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Output: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning? is the leaning tower of pisa meant to lean? has the leaning tower of pisa always been leaning?]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage. Input:The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify. Output: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home? has a nfl team won superbowl at home? has there ever been a host team in the super bowl? has a nfl team ever played at home for the super bowl? can a super bowl team play at home? has an nfl team ever played a super bowl in their own stadium? has a superbowl team ever played at their home stadium? has a super bowl team played at home?]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction:You will be given a passage, and your task is to generate a Yes/No question that is answerable based on the given passage.

A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress.

Il aura fallu 40 ANS pour que le PEPLUM prennent une nouvelle dimension et cette haute Valeur avec ce film dont la teneur est revisitée à la fois par RIDLEY SCOTT et la force et le charisme de RUSSEL CROWE avec cette finesse dans un scénario sans faille d'aucune sorte, MAXIMUS un Général Romain victorieux et préféré  du CAESAR MARC AURELLE au grand dam de son propre fils qui choisit de ne pas le \"nommer\" CAESAR car le juge faible, il y préfère la loyauté de MAXIMUS, sa grande force morale, sa tempérence, son honneur, ceci lui coutera la vie, il sera assassiné par ce fils despotique ! Mais il ne s'en arrêtera pas là ! MAXIMUS sera déchu par lui et tentera même de le faire assassiner par sa garde prétorienne !

La déception est à la hauteur des attentes mises dans le film: énorme! Lucas qui n'est pourtant pas dans le besoin à fait un film 100% commercial et sans aucune profondeur. Le film s'adresse aux enfants: pas bête le George les gosses se font accompagner par Papa et hop pour un spectateur 2 places vendues! En plus ce sont les mômes qui achètent les jouets et autre merchandising. Les effet spéciaux sont superbes pas de problème mais comme dirait Bacri ce qui fait un film c'est avant tout le scénario. Le scénario est comme la menace Fantôme! L'histoire avance par à coup sans vraiment de lien entre les impressionnantes scènes d'action. L'extraterrestre Ja-ja est digne de Disney et les autres personnages sont inexistants, plats et fades. Darth Maul parlons en! En dehors de son look d'enfer: rien. Il aligne peut être dix mots avant de se faire tuer. Qui est il, d'où vient il? Où est le suspens? Où sont les surprises et les révélations? Où est Harrisson Ford et son humour?

Quand on évoque les Tontons, on pense immédiatemment à la scène de la cuissine, aux \"bourre-pif\" que se prend Blier, au \"gugusse de Montauban\"... Chaque scène, chaque réplique des Tontons est mythique. La scène de la cuisine est cependant la plus mémorable, car voir sur le même plan Lino, Blanche, Blier et Lefevre complètement déchenillés et là, il n'y avait pas de doublures, nous rappelle que ce cinéma populaire et de qualité marquait un âge d'or du septième art.

Bien sûr, il faut avoir vécu cette époque pour apprécier toutes les subtilités de ce génial artiste !

Lamentable film ou l'art et la manière de salir un pays et son peuple. Adapté d'un livre le scénario s'écarte des faits relatés dans le  livre afin d'ajouter du sensationnel de dramatiser, d'inventer de toute pièce des situations, d'inventer des dialogues qui n'ont jamais existés des situations abracabrantesques qui ne figurent nulle part dans le texte original. Hollywood a donner sa dimension nauséabonde pour porter un lourd préjudice envers la Turquie et son peuple. devant tant d'ignominies on est bien obligé de se poser la question de savoir quels sont les interêts occultes qui ont financé \"l'oeuvre\" misérable. Ce film est ignoble car il est le prototype flagrant du mensonge et du racontar de bas étage sciemment élaboré et mis en scène avec toute la technicité diabolique pour servir le sombre dessein de la haine aveugle ornée de la fieleuse diffamation au seul profit de l'argent et du sensationnel.

Certes on est loin d'avoir bien adapté le livre mais pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas le livre, ce dvd est le meilleur au niveau effet visuel (la bataille finale mon dieu quelle beauté !!!!!!)

Ce Cd commence par \"We don't need this fascit groove thang\", titre militant écrit contre la montée des extrémistes de droite dans le monde, symbolisée selon le groupe par l'élection en 1980 de Ronald Reagan aux USA. Ce titre, le meilleur de l'album, sera plus ou moins censuré par la maison de disques du groupe.  Du groupe ? Plutôt un collectif formé par deux « dissidents » de Human League fin 1980, également au centre de la nébuleuse British Electric Foundation, collectif de musique électronique destiné à conquérir les hit-parades mondiaux.  Bon, l'objectif n'a pas été atteint, à cause d'une musique aujourd'hui très typée mais qui même à l'époque n'avait guère convaincu. Uniquement à base de synthés, truffée d'effets faciles et simplistes, trop prévisibles.  Heaven 17 eut paraît-il une certaine influence sur Soft Cell et Depeche Mode à leurs débuts.

Cet album à le mérite de traduire à merveille , grâce à son titre , le désordre intérieur qu'il procure à un auditeur comme moi .  A l'écoute d'Octavarium , je pensais que le groupe avait enfin compris qu'en matière de musique , la technique ne trouvait sa place qu'à la seule condition qu'elle permette à chacun des morceaux de se hisser et de nous emmener vers les chemins de l'ambiant , de la beauté et de l'émotion au lieu de la conjuguer trop souvent en démonstration stylistique ou la rapidité et la facilité technique des protagonistes fini toujours par prendre le pas sur la mélodie . Malheureusement DT ne l'a toujours pas compris et ennuie , pire ! nous écoeur par delà ses prouesses , nous gavant telle une oie d'un déluge de n'importe quoi . De plus , lorsqu'une once d'inspiration vient se glisser quelques fois au milieu de cette partouze sonore , celle ci nous démontre d'abord , qu'avant d'être des Fans , la bande à Portnoy ne parvient au final qu'à pillier sans vergogne l'héritage de ses glorieux ainés ( YES , GENESIS ou FLOYD au registre du Prog ) .    La grande différence finalement , c'est que tous ces \"Anciens\" ne sortaient nullement de toutes ces prestigieuses écoles américaines , mais jouaient  avant tout avec coeur , feeling et sensibilité .

Input:Quel retour ! . 11 ans déjà depuis le dernier album ! On n'osait même plus ésperer un nouvel album. Et voila que se pointe le 3ème opus de Portishead. On avait même une petite crainte : est ce que ce sera toujours aussi bon ? est ce que j'apprécierai toujours autant malgré le temps écoulé ? Et la réponse dans les deux cas est un énorme OUI ! Leur musique a évolué (et c'est tant mieux : il est loin le temps du trip hop 90's) mais la marque de fabrique Portishead est là et bien là. La voix de Beth Gibbons est toujours aussi déchirante, l'atmosphère, plus rock et plus électro à la fois est immédiatement reconnaissable. Tous les titres sont bons, certains surprennent ('Deep Water' au Ukulélé, 'Machine gun' et sa rythmique martiale et un peu effrayante) d'autres sont absolument bluffants ('small' : il y a bien longtemps que je n'avais pas entendu un morceau aussi bien construit...)

Ocho años más tarde, en 1909, habían 281 754 judíos (36,9 %), 18 189 protestantes (2,4 %) y 2818 mariavitas (0,4 %). Esto llevó a la construcción, por toda la ciudad, de cientos de lugares de culto religioso; la mayoría de los cuales fueron destruidos tras el Alzamiento de Varsovia en 1944. Al finalizar la guerra, las nuevas autoridades comunistas de Polonia desincentivaron la construcción de iglesias y muy pocas fueron reconstruidas. Output: ¿Qué tipo de ciudad ha sido siempre Varsovia desde su existencia? ¿Cuál era la población de Varsovia en 1901? De los habitantes de Varsovia en 1901, ¿qué porcentaje era católico? ¿Qué porcentaje de la población de Varsovia era protestante en 1901? ¿Cuándo fueron destruidos la mayoría de los lugares de culto religioso en Varsovia?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a paragraph in Spanish, your job is to generate a spanish question that can be answered from the passage.

Input:A medida que el noroeste de Europa comenzó a calentarse lentamente hace 22 000 años, el subsuelo congelado y los glaciares alpinos expandidos comenzaron a descongelarse y las cubiertas de nieve de otoño-invierno se derritieron en la primavera. Gran parte de la descarga se dirigió al Rin y su extensión río abajo. El rápido calentamiento y los cambios de vegetación, para abrir el bosque, comenzaron alrededor del 13 000 BP. Para el 9000 BP, Europa estaba completamente cubierta de bosques. Con la reducción global de la cubierta de hielo, los niveles de agua del océano subieron y el Canal de la Mancha y el Mar del Norte se reintegraron. El agua de deshielo, sumado al hundimiento del océano y de la tierra, ahogó las antiguas costas de Europa de manera desproporcionada. Output: ¿Cuándo empezó a calentarse lentamente Europa desde la última Edad de Hielo? ¿Qué empezaron a hacer el subsuelo congelado y los glaciares alpinos expandidos? ¿Adónde fue la descarga de los glaciares en Europa en la última Edad de Hielo? ¿Cuándo comenzó el calentamiento rápido y ayudó a la vegetación? ¿Cuándo estaba Europa completamente cubierta de bosques y recuperada de la última Edad de Hielo?]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a paragraph in Spanish, your job is to generate a spanish question that can be answered from the passage.

Input:A medida que la amistad entre Jamukha y Temujin se fue distanciando, cada uno comenzó a consolidar su poder, y pronto se convirtieron en rivales. Jamukha apoyó la aristocracia tradicional mongola, mientras que Temüjin siguió un método meritocrático, y atrajo a una mayor variedad de seguidores, aunque de clase más baja. Debido a su anterior derrota a los merkitas y a la proclamación del chamán Kokochu de que el Cielo Azul Eterno había dejado el mundo a un lado por Temujin, este comenzó a elevarse al poder. En 1186, Temujin fue elegido khan de los mongoles. Sin embargo, Jamukha, amenazado por el rápido ascenso de Temujin, rápidamente se movilizó para detener sus ambiciones. En 1187, lanzó un ataque contra su antiguo amigo con un ejército de treinta mil soldados. Temujin se apresuró a reunir a sus seguidores para defenderse contra el ataque, pero fue derrotado contundentemente en la batalla de Dalan Balzhut. Jamukha horrorizó enormemente a la gente y dañó su imagen al poner a hervir vivos en calderas a setenta jóvenes varones cautivos, distanciando a muchos de sus potenciales seguidores y suscitando simpatía por Temujin. Toghrul, como patrón de Temujin, fue exiliado a la Qara Khitai. La vida de Temujin durante los próximos diez años es muy poco clara, ya que los registros históricos guardan silencio sobre ese período. Output: ¿A quién apoyó Jamukha que no formaba parte de la base de poder de Temujin? ¿La proclamación de qué chamán ayudó al ascenso de Temujin? ¿Cuándo fue Temujin elegido khan de los mongoles? ¿Qué batalla perdió Temujin contra Jamukha poco después de su elección como khan? ¿Dónde estaba exiliado el patrón de Temujin, Toghrul?]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a paragraph in Spanish, your job is to generate a spanish question that can be answered from the passage.

Input:A principios de los años 70, ABC completó su transición al color; la década en su conjunto marcaría un punto de inflexión para ABC, ya que comenzó a pasar a CBS y NBC en las clasificaciones para convertirse en la primera cadena de televisión del mundo. También comenzó a utilizar datos de comportamiento y demográficos para determinar mejor a qué tipos de patrocinadores vender los espacios publicitarios y proporcionar programación que atraería a ciertas audiencias. El aumento de la cuota de audiencia de ABC se vio muy favorecido por el hecho de que varios mercados más pequeños habían crecido lo suficiente como para permitir afiliaciones a tiempo completo desde las tres redes. Output: ¿Qué tiene una influencia negativa sobre la economía de los Estados Unidos? A nivel internacional, ¿qué posiciones competitivas de la industria se ven afectadas? ¿Qué problema tiene efectos tanto inflacionarios como deflacionarios? La crisis del petróleo hizo que las compañías petroleras aumentaran el suministro de petróleo, ¿en qué zona? ¿Cuánto tiempo tardan las nuevas zonas en tener una producción de petróleo significativa?]\n\n",

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Input: At Madeline Hall, an old mansion-house near Southampton belonging to the wealthy de Versely family, lives an elderly spinster Miss Delmar, the aunt of the earl de Versely and Captain Delmar. Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.\nThe family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.\nWhen Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.\nAfter his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain's life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Cura ao to convince his fellow officers they've been poisoned. He also keeps correspondence with Minnie, developing a romance with the beautiful heiress.\nNear the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged. After being saved by another English vessel, he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely's sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property. Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father's name. He later journey's with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie, but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying. During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks, Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road. At the end of the novel, Percival proposes to Minnie, and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father. He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar.

Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Input:Passage: The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George Citizen by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event. Output: What is the first name of the person who doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes?]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Input:Passage: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.\nAs a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent.\nThrough his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. Output: What is the last name of the person who is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music? What is the last name of the person who also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle?

Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Input:Passage: By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life. He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of Béla Bartók.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bartók, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work. Output: What is the nickname for the thing that Lucas and Nichols believed would eventually arrive on New York's coastline? What is the first name of the person who is believed to have caught the Jersey man-eater? What is the last name of the person who believed a sea turtle was responsible for the attack? What is the first name of the person who said he spent much time at sea and along shore, and had several times seen turtles large enough to inflict just such wounds? What is the full name of the person who said sea turtles are of a vicious disposition?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Output: And may distinguish the hypocrites who were told: \"Fight in the way of God, or defend yourselves,\" and who had replied: \"If we knew of the fight we would have followed you.\" They were nearer unbelief than faith on that day, and they said with their tongues what was not in their hearts; but God is aware of what they hide. And in order to expose them who turned hypocrites; and it was said to them, “Come, fight in Allah's cause, or repel the enemy”; they answered, “If we knew how to fight, we would certainly have been with you”; and on that day they were nearer to open disbelief than to professed faith; they utter with their mouths what is not in their hearts; and Allah knows well what they hide. – and that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said of them, 'Come now, fight in the way of God, or repel!' They said, 'If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you.'

And it was said unto them: come ye, fight in the way of Allah or defend. They said: if we knew it was to be a fair fight We would surely have followed you.

And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: \"Come, fight in the Way of Allah or (at least) defend yourselves.\" They said: \"Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.\" They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.

And when these hypocrites were asked: 'Come and fight in the wayof Allah', or (at least) 'defend yourselves', they answered: 'If we but knew that there would be fighting, we would certainly have followed. They were nearer then to infidelity than to faith. They utter from their mouths what is not in their hearts. Allah knows well what they conceal. And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: \"Come, fight in the way of Allah or defend yourselves.\" They said: \"Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.\" They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.

If they accuse you of lying, messengers before you were accused of lying. They came with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Scripture. Now, if they give the lie to you, then other Messengers who came bearing clear signs and scriptures and the illuminating Book were also given the lie before you. Then if they reject you, so were Messengers rejected before you, who came with Al-Bayinat and the Scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment. Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment.]\n\n",

Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day.

Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time.

Otherwise, it is considered negative. Input:Review: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix. \n Polarity: Negative Output: True]\n\n[Question 19 Instruction:Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Input: Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the  revolutionary idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , Kishiko Miyagi , Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor.fill in the blank  : Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in __________________ 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this .

Input:The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a  modern battle  divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game 's opening theme song ,  If You Wish for ...  ( もしも君が願うのなら , Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May 'n . Its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty . Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi , who had worked on May 'n on previous singles . fill in the blank  :The music was composed by Hitoshi __________________ , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games .

Input:In September 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by Sega , hinting at a new Valkyria Chronicles game . In its September issue , Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable . Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show ( TGS ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . During the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events , an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011 . The game was released January 27 , 2011 . During an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( DLC ) , but that no plans were finalized . Multiple DLC maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between February and April 2011 . An expanded edition of the game , Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition , released on November 23 , 2011 . Packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , Extra Edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game 's DLC , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . Unlike its two predecessors , Valkyria Chronicles III was not released in the west . According to Sega , this was due to poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west . An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012 : players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch , which translated the game 's text into English . Compatible with the Extra Edition , the patch was released in January 2014 . fill in the blank  :   In September 2010 , a __________________ website was revealed by Sega , hinting at a new Valkyria Chronicles game .

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:'The Islamic State', formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and before that as the 'Islamic State of Iraq', (and called the acronym Daesh by its many detractors), is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria. In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide. As of March 2015[update], it had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, and has nominal control over small areas of Libya, Nigeria and Afghanistan. (While a self-described state, it lacks international recognition.) The group also operates or has affiliates in other parts of the world, including North Africa and South Asia. Output: What type of group is The Islamic State? Who leads The Islamic State? How many people did the Islamic State control the territory of as of March 2015? What does the Islamic State lack from the international community? What did the Islamic State proclaim itself in 2014?]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Output: Who oversees a Pharmacy Technician in the UK? With what body must a pharmacy technician register? What is a main duty of the GPhC? What type of professional is a Pharmacy Technician considered to be? What types of responsibilities might a pharmacy technician have?]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland. Output: What German ruler invited Huguenot immigration? What German poet was descended from Huguenots? What German general and fighter pilot was of Huguenot ancestry? Who was the final Prime Minister of East Germany? Thomas de Maiziere serves what role in the German cabinet?]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement. The statement was in Latin, apart from 'We are beggars,' which was in German. Output: What was later discovered written by Luther? In what language was most of the statement written? What portion of Luther's last statement was in German?]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 · 3, 1 · 1 · 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3. Output: What is the only divisor besides 1 that a prime number can have? What are numbers greater than 1 that can be divided by 3 or more numbers called? What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory? Any number larger than 1 can be represented as a product of what? Why must one be excluded in order to preserve the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem?]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] Output: What is another term for rotors? In a steam turbine, what are rotors mounted on? What is another way of referring to stators? What are stators attached to? In the United States, what is a usual turbine speed with 60 Hertz of power?]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cramér's conjecture. Output: What conjecture holds that there is an infinite amount of twin primes? What is a twin prime? Which conjecture holds that for any positive integer n, there is an infinite amount of pairs of consecutive primes differing by 2n? Of what form is the infinite amount of primes that comprise the special cases of Schinzel's hypothesis? What conjecture holds that there are always a minimum of 4 primes  between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2?]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:A variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of 'blood poisoning') and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis. Output: What does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease? What was Norman Cantor's theory about the plague? Which diseases do many scientists believe contributed to plague pandemic? What is septicemia? How many bodies did Public Health England exhume?]\n\n[Question 8 Instruction:Given a paragraph, your job is to generate a question that can be answered from the passage. The answer to your question should be a single entity, person, time, etc. that can be extracted from the passage. Input:However, his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made. For example, in his article, 'A Machine to End War', published in 1937, Tesla stated: Output: What article was published in 1937? Because of certain statements what was the believed state of his religious views? In the article's title, what did the machine hope to end?]\n\n",

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show. Also, the name 'Game of Thrones' gives more information about what will happen in the TV series (politics and fight for the throne) than the name A song of ice and fire does. Game of Thrones is still a very suitable title, yes it is the title of the first book but the entire span of the series covers the game being played for the Iron Throne. A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person. Note also that the phrase is used in the other books and is perhaps even better than the series title at describing in one phrase the whole point of the books.  <sep>  Q: Why is the TV show titled \"Game of Thrones\" and not \"A Song of Ice and Fire?\" A: A Song of Ice and Fire really sounds quite fantasy-ish, whereas Game of Thrones sounds medieval and more suitable for a show  Q: True, but the book series is called \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" don't you think that would attract more people who were fans of the book? A: he phrase is used in the other books  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: \"Game of Thrones\" is just the name of the first book, won't fans think show is about only that book instead of the whole series? Output: A Song of Ice and Fire is sophisticated and poetic, but Game of Thrones is direct and exciting and very easily remembered. And that's what counts for the average person]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: The Avengers is an Initiative: a sanctioned team brought together to defend the world against threats beyond the scope of SHIELD and the world's governments. Captain America is the first Avenger not only because he was the first to be recruited (Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then), but because the super-soldier program of the 1940's was a wartime pre-cursor to the Avengers program, albeit one that was stalled by espionage. Captain America was quite clearly the first member of the team to sign up to a government initiative to defend innocent life. Ruben Studdard was 25 when he won American Idol in the 2nd Series, and Kelly Clarkson was only 20 when she won the first series. We don't refer to Studdard as the first American Idol winner, do we?  <sep>  Q: Why do we say that Captain America is the first avenger? A: because he was the first to be recruited  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: So, Thor was recruited after him even though he is older? Output: Thor doesn't even know about the Avengers until partway through the movie: even Stark was aware of their existence before then]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: She doesn't want to torture Sherlock, she wants to play with him. Specifically, she wants him to play with her. At least, that's what the childhood version of herself wants and it manifests in modern day as the torturous puzzling she sets up for Sherlock. Eurus lacks human emotion and, thus, doesn't see what she does as torturing her brother.  <sep>  Q: What is Eurus's motive in the final problem A: She doesn't want to torture Sherlock, she wants to play with him. Specifically, she wants him to play with her  Q: Were they friends as children? A: that's what the childhood version of herself wants and it manifests in modern day as the torturous puzzling she sets up for Sherlock  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Does she kill redbeard? Output: Eurus lacks human emotion and, thus, doesn't see what she does as torturing her brother]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: Spider-Man: Homecoming is following the Captain America: Civil War. I've seen the same trailer - and the clip with Spidey holding Cap's shield seems to be lifted straight from the CA:CW movie during the airport fight. Later in the trailer (or in another trailer), Peter is boasting to his friend about meeting Iron Man and the Avengers, and how he stole Captain America's shield from him.  <sep>  Q: Why did I see Spider-Man with Captain America's shield in his hand? A: he stole Captain America's shield from him  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: When did he do that? Output: His tree house turned into an Enterprise bridge look-alike in the same video which is from the episode \"Boy Toy]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: I'm afraid you completely misunderstood a lot of the movie. At the start of the movie, Hal is already dead (killed himself in prison). Those scenes with Hal (mostly in New York) were all flashbacks. The present is with sister in San Francisco. Jasmine meets Dwight at a party in San Francisco. This is long after Hal killed himself. But to your question: \"Why did Jasmine arrest Hal?\" It was purely a spur of the moment, revenge thing. Hal had just told Jasmine that he was in love with this French girl and was going to leave her. And almost immediately, Jasmine calls the FBI (or rather calls someone to get the FBI's number).  <sep>  Q: Why did Jasmine arrest Hal? A: It was purely a spur of the moment, revenge thing  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Who did Jasmine sleep with? Output: Dwight]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: The money belonged to Barr so it had his fingerprints on it. The gun was also Barr's as was the van. The whole point of Charlie's actions were to frame Barr for the killing. He had befriended Barr to get close to him and was close enough to be able to drug him and take the various pieces of property away from Barr's house and to return them with incriminating evidence without Barr realising he'd been set up. If I remember correctly the movie shows a jar filled with coins on Barr's desk. Presumably Charlie just took one of these to leave that final piece of incriminating evidence in the multi-story car park.  <sep>  Q: How did Charlie get Barr Finger prints? A: Charlie just took one of these to leave that final piece of incriminating evidence  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What did Charlie take one of? Output: If I remember correctly the movie shows a jar filled with coins on Barr's desk. Presumably Charlie just took one of these]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph.

A: The money belonged to Barr so it had his fingerprints on it  Q: How does that explain the scene with the coin? A: If I remember correctly the movie shows a jar filled with coins on Barr's desk  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Did he use the coin to get the prints? Output: Presumably Charlie just took one of these to leave that final piece of incriminating evidence in the multi-story car park]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: For the same reason that Jeff doesn't immediately call the police with his suspicions: fear that if Thorwald realizes he has been made by an outside observer, he will dispose of all the evidence and escape without prosecution... Lisa is buying more time by being taken under arrest, and the event was intended to appease Thorwald to some extent. He was already making mistakes (retaining his wife's wedding ring due to sentimentality), and Lisa was clinging onto the thought that their plan was not yet foiled. The arrest itself was actually a means of getting Lisa safely out of the apartment, and of getting the wedding ring (as evidence) into the hands of the police.  <sep>  Q: Why didn't Lisa tell the truth about Thorwald to the police? A: fear that if Thorwald realizes he has been made by an outside observer, he will dispose of all the evidence and escape without prosecution  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: Why did she get herself arrested? Output: Lisa is buying more time by being taken under arrest]\n\n[Question 8 Instruction:Given a paragraph about movies, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph. The paragraph has the prefix 'CONTEXT:'. Each conversation question has a prefix `Q:` followed by the answer prefix `A:`, and the follow-up question has a prefix `FOLLOWUP_Q:`. Input:CONTEXT: Because Sam was their top earner and with the change in casinos after their trial, they kept him around to keep earning. He had already proven himself during his previous trials about his license and not only that, he survived the bombing. This had two implications, first is that he wasn't like Nicky and the second, he had far too much press after he survived the bombing as he was the center of attention with the gaming board. They really couldn't kill him without proving they (the bosses) were involved.  <sep>  Q: Why was Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein spared by the bosses? A: Because Sam was their top earner and with the change in casinos after their trial, they kept him around to keep earning  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: The bosses decide to eliminate anyone involved or with knowledge of the skim Output: He had already proven himself during his previous trials about his license and not only that, he survived the bombing]\n\n",

Input:Abstract: The use of atracurium during major abdominal surgery was assessed in 20 infants with hepatic dysfunction caused by biliary atresia. An initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients. Subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch. Neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Anesthesia, Intratracheal 2)Atracurium 3)Biliary Atresia 4)Drug Administration Schedule 5)Female 6)Human 7)Infant 8)Infant, Newborn 9)Intraoperative Care 10)Liver 11)Male 12)Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Output: Yes]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Input:Abstract: Six patients with bowenoid papulosis and two patients with Bowen's disease of the genital area were treated by means of an argon, Nd:YAG, and CO2 laser. In all of the patients, complete resolution of the lesions was achieved. Due to a superficial coagulating effect, application of the argon laser should be restricted to macular and papular pigmented lesions. In contrast, Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers could be used even for treatment of extensive leukoplakia-like and verrucous lesions. Advantages and disadvantages of these two lasers are discussed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged Output: No]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract.

Input:Abstract: A behavioural method of habit reversal, in combination with a hydrocortisone cream, was compared with the use of cream alone in the treatment of 17 patients with atopic dermatitis. The patients were assigned randomly to two groups, one of which received the combination treatment and the other regular ointment treatment. The patients' skin status was assessed before and after treatment, and the patients recorded their scratching during the study. Both groups improved, but the group which received habit-reversal therapy improved significantly more. A strong correlation was found between reduction in scratching and improvement in skin status. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Behavior Therapy 4)Combined Modality Therapy 5)Dermatitis, Atopic 6)Human 7)Hydrocortisone 8)Middle Age 9)Ointments 10)Pruritus 11)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.

If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: The lifetime prevalence of psychiatric illness was determined in 114 patients with diabetes mellitus (types I and II) who were selected randomly from patients undergoing diabetes evaluations at a large medical center. The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Amino Acid Sequence 2)Animal 3)Base Sequence Output: No]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: Active forms of vitamin D3, 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, were administered in an open-design study to 40 patients with psoriasis vulgaris in three ways: to 17 patients 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 1.0 micrograms/day for 6 months, to four patients 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was given orally at a dose of 0.5 microgram/day for 6 months, and 19 patients were given 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 applied topically at concentration of 0.5 microgram/g of base for 8 weeks. Improvement was observed at the end of the individual study periods in 13 (76%) patients in Group 1 with a mean period of treatment (+/- SD) of 2.7 +/- 0.6 months, in one patient in Group 2 at 3 months after the start of treatment, and in 16 (84%) patients in Group 3 when the chemical was applied for 3.3 +/- 1.2 weeks. No side-effects were observed in any of these trials. These data suggest that psoriasis may respond to active metabolites of vitamin D3 and that abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism or in responsiveness of the skin cells to active metabolites of vitamin D may be involved in the pathogenesis of this skin disease. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adolescence 2)Adult 3)Aged 4)Calcitonin 5)Cholecalciferols 6)Dihydroxycholecalciferols 7)Female 8)Human 9)Hydroxycholecalciferols 10)Male 11)Middle Age 12)Parathyroid Hormones 13)Psoriasis 14)Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.

These cases were compared with previously reported cases of malignant eccrine poroma that had metastasised, and it is suggested that a strict classification of malignant eccrine sweat gland tumours should be made. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Adaptation, Physiological 2)Animal 3)Comparative Study Output: No]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Input:Abstract: Multivariate analysis on an unselected patient population consisting of all 253 children treated for neuroblastoma in Denmark during 1943 to 1980 shows that stage, age, and treatment given are independent prognostic variables. Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Age Factors 2)Child 3)Child, Preschool 4)Denmark 5)Female 6)Human 7)Male 8)Neuroblastoma 9)Prognosis 10)Regression Analysis 11)Sex Factors.

From 1 September 1982 to 31 August 1983 75 patients, 27 females and 48 males were admitted to the Burns Unit in Copenhagen. The majority of burns were domestic and fire was the predominant cause. The most vulnerable areas were the arms and the legs, and small children still have the highest incidence of thermal injury. As predisposing factors were of significance in several accidents, the importance of further prevention is stressed. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Accidents, Home 2)Burns 3)Denmark 4)Female 5)Fires 6)Human 7)Male.

Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford. It is currently described by two competing standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations.

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Given a text passage, you need to generate a suitable title as the output. The output title should be one of the words/phrases used in the passage and must be no longer than five words.  Input:Paragraph:    As with previous Valkyira Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \n The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \n Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , Shocktroopers , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier . Troopers can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon . Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class . With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types .   Question: what is the suitable title of the passage ? Output:  Gameplay]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a text passage, you need to generate a suitable title as the output. The output title should be one of the words/phrases used in the passage and must be no longer than five words.  Input:Paragraph:    The game takes place during the Second Europan War . Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as \" The Nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , Altaha Abilia , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela Marcellis , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria . Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers . \n As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war . While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , Gusurg , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort . This continues until the Nameless 's commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason . \n Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force . This is short @-@ lived , however , as following Maximilian 's defeat , Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire , kept secret by their benefactor . Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia , it is Dahau 's last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation . As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations ' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless , asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action . Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon . Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew .

The output title should be one of the words/phrases used in the passage and must be no longer than five words.  Input:Paragraph:    In September 2010 , a teaser website was revealed by Sega , hinting at a new Valkyria Chronicles game . In its September issue , Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable . Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show ( TGS ) , where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees . During the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events , an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011 . The game was released January 27 , 2011 . During an interview , the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content ( DLC ) , but that no plans were finalized . Multiple DLC maps , featuring additional missions and recruitable characters , were released between February and April 2011 . An expanded edition of the game , Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition , released on November 23 , 2011 . Packaged and sold at a lower price than the original , Extra Edition game with seven additional episodes : three new , three chosen by staff from the game 's DLC , and one made available as a pre @-@ order bonus . People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . \n Unlike its two predecessors , Valkyria Chronicles III was not released in the west . According to Sega , this was due to poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west . An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012 : players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch , which translated the game 's text into English . Compatible with the Extra Edition , the patch was released in January 2014 .   Question: what is the suitable title of the passage ?

You need to come up with a fictional story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. Make sure that your story does not repeat the relation in the given paragraph (e.g., by avoiding verbatim copies of the given paragraph). Start by reading the background paragraph, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. Write a story that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to use your own words as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph. Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let's say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. Output: A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail. His son came along and saw the two cups and decided to put some sugar in them to make a tasty drink. The child poured two spoonfuls of sugar into cup A and three spoonfuls of sugar into cup B.]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Output: Jacob has lived in a city in Sweden for most of his life. His favorite hobbies are reading and playing videogames so he rarely goes outside. Even as a kid, he almost never played outside and instead was in his house most of the time. Martin lives in the middle of the Sahara desert in a small town. The sun almost never stops beating down on Martin during the day and it's hard to find shade where he lives.]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Output: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \"atom L\" and the smaller one \"atom S\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work.]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Feel free to make up places and events as long as they tie back to the background paragraph in a way that you can ask a question about. Input:Background Paragraph: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Output: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now.]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Input:Background Paragraph: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children. Output: Doctor Brown examined two groups of patients: Group O, with members over 65, and group P, with members under 65 years of age. The study was about the effects on aging on the human body. Doctors studied two groups of individuals: group O with people over 65, and group S with people under 65 years old. They published the results in a magazine. Joe studied the lives of humans. He studied 2 groups of people. Group G had people over 65 in it, and group Y had people under 65 years old in it. Ted had 2 uncles. Uncle Jerry was getting up there in age, he was 78 years-old. Uncle Tom was younger, he was in his early 50's and still very active and productive. Two friends named Jill and Jane met after many years and had a chat over a cup of tea. Jane was 70 years-old, while Jill was 55. They shared many stories. Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. Group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition. Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition. Two neighboring towns had different demographics. Hill town had younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30's and 40's. Lake town was inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age. two buildings had different tenants. Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old.]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Input:Background Paragraph: A vapor light also produces visible light by electroluminescence The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight pictured in the Figure below , produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. In addition to lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light highways and stadiums. The bulbs are very bright and long lasting so they are a good choice for these places. Output: Joe walks into his house to see that his son has replaced the light bulbs in both the kitchen and the bathroom. The kitchen is now glowing blue because of the light bulb, and the bathroom has a yellow tint to it. Joe decides he needs to find his son to figure out what type of light bulbs these are and why he chose them. Joey just purchased two new vapor light bulbs for his apartment and is excited to install them since they glow neat colors. He is going to install a different bulb in each room to give different colored glows to the rooms and to make his apartment seem more dynamic. In his bedroom he has decided to install a bulb that gives off a blue glow. He also picked up a bulb that glows yellow and will be putting that in his closet. However, after screwing the bulbs in, only the one in his closet glows, and Joey is not sure why.]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

Input:Background Paragraph: A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. Output: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

What additional information could I provide?Edit: I can rule out oyster sauce. I asked in a restaurant what the black stuff was, but either she didn't understand me or she didn't want to (all she told me was that it contained salt). Finally she said she made it herself.

Input:Abstract: BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is regarded as one of the most common malignancies and among the leading causes of cancer death among the whole world. The most urgent needs are to find sensitive markers for early diagnosis for HCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported as a group of small non-coding RNAs that can function as endogenous RNA interference to regulate expression of the targeted genes. This study was conducted to detect the serum and tissue expression of miR 21 and miR 199-a to be applied as early detectors for HCC.   \n METHODS A total of 40 serum and tissue samples (17 samples from chronic hepatitis and 23 samples from HCC patients) were collected. The levels of the two mature miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-199-a) were detected by real time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) in sera and tissues of chronic hepatitis and HCC patients. Besides, miR-21 and miR-199-a levels in relation to clinical and pathological factors were explored.   \n RESULTS We found that the expression of serum miR-21 was distinctly increased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). miR 199-a was distinctly decreased in HCC compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.001). In addition, median of miR 21 was increased in malignant when compared to adjacent non-malignant tissues without significant differences (P=0.191) while miR 199-a was significantly decreased in malignant when compared to adjacent nonmalignant tissues (P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that miR-21 and miR-199-a might be potential biomarkers for HCC.   \n CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the expression of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated and miR-199-a was significantly down regulated in serum of patients with HCC. Due to their reasonable sensitivity and specificity for disease progression, miR-21 and miR-199-a could be used as potential circulating biomarkers for HCC..

Your task is to generate label \"yes\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \"no\". Input:Abstract: BACKGROUND In the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD), enalapril reduced mortality in patients with symptomatic but not asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction during the trial. We did a 12-year follow-up of SOLVD to establish if the mortality reduction with enalapril among patients with heart failure was sustained, and whether a subsequent reduction in mortality would emerge among those with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction.   \n METHODS Of the 6797 patients previously enrolled in the SOLVD prevention and treatment trials, we ascertained the subsequent vital status of 5165 individuals who were alive when the trials had been completed. Follow-up was done through direct contacts in Belgium and linkages with national death registries and federal beneficiary or historic tax summary files in the USA and Canada.   \n FINDINGS Follow-up was 99.8% (6784/6797) complete. In the prevention trial, 50.9% (1074/2111) of the enalapril group had died compared with 56.4% (1195/2117) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.001). In the treatment trial, 79.8% (1025/1285) of the enalapril group had died compared with 80.8% (1038/1284) of the placebo group (generalised Wilcoxon p=0.01). The reductions in cardiac deaths were significant and similar in both trials. When data for the prevention and treatment trials were combined, the hazard ratio for death was 0.90 for the enalapril group compared with the placebo group (95% CI 0.84-0.95, generalised Wilcoxon p=0.0003). Enalapril extended median survival by 9.4 months in the combined trials (95% CI 2.8-16.5, p=0.004).   \n INTERPRETATION Treatment with enalapril for 3-4 years led to a sustained improvement in survival beyond the original trial period in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an important increase in life expectancy..

Your task is to generate label \"yes\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \"no\". Input:Abstract: An orthotopic model of human melanoma was developed in which malignant cells were injected into human skin grafted to nude and SCID mice. Melanoma cells proliferated and invaded the human skin grafts with characteristic patterns. Three of six melanomas grew as multiple nodules and infiltered the grafts without major architectural changes in the dermis, whereas the others invaded the dermis along collagen fibers with prominent endothelial vessels. By contrast, melanoma cells inoculated into mouse skin grew as diffusely expanding nodules that did not invade the murine dermis. In human skin grafts, human melanoma cells were angiogenic for human blood vessels, and murine vessels were only found at the periphery of grafts. Tumor cells invaded the human vessels, and four out of seven cell lines metastasized to lungs, suggesting that this model is useful to determine in vivo the interactions between normal and malignant human cells..

Input:Abstract: Expression of peripheral antigens in the thymus has been implicated in T cell tolerance and autoimmunity. Here we identified medullary thymic epithelial cells as being a unique cell type that expresses a diverse range of tissue-specific antigens. We found that this promiscuous gene expression was a cell-autonomous property of medullary epithelial cells and was maintained during the entire period of thymic T cell output. It may facilitate tolerance induction to self-antigens that would otherwise be temporally or spatially secluded from the immune system. However, the array of promiscuously expressed self-antigens appeared random rather than selected and was not confined to secluded self-antigens..

Your task is to generate label \"yes\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \"no\". Input:Abstract: Angiogenesis and cancer invasiveness greatly contribute to cancer malignancy. Arf6 and its effector, AMAP1, are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and constitute a central pathway to induce the invasion and metastasis. In this pathway, Arf6 is activated by EGFR via GEP100. Arf6 is highly expressed also in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and is implicated in angiogenesis. Here, we found that HUVECs also highly express AMAP1, and that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) recruits GEP100 to activate Arf6. AMAP1 functions by binding to cortactin in cancer invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that the same GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1-cortactin pathway is essential for angiogenesis activities, including cell migration and tubular formation, as well as for the enhancement of cell permeability and VE-cadherin endocytosis of VEGF-stimulated HUVECs. Components of this pathway are highly expressed in pathologic angiogenesis, and blocking of this pathway effectively inhibits VEGF- or tumor-induced angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization. The GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1-cortactin pathway, activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, appears to be common in angiogenesis and cancer invasion and metastasis, and provides their new therapeutic targets.. Title: GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1-Cortactin Pathway Frequently Used in Cancer Invasion Is Activated by VEGFR2 to Promote Angiogenesis Output: yes]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \"yes\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \"no\". Input:Abstract: The physiological role of autophagic flux within the vascular endothelial layer remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in primary endothelial cells, oxidized and native LDL stimulates autophagosome formation. Moreover, by both confocal and electron microscopy, excess native or modified LDL appears to be engulfed within autophagic structures. Transient knockdown of the essential autophagy gene ATG7 resulted in higher levels of intracellular (125) I-LDL and oxidized LDL (OxLDL) accumulation, suggesting that in endothelial cells, autophagy may represent an important mechanism to regulate excess, exogenous lipids. The physiological importance of these observations was assessed using mice containing a conditional deletion of ATG7 within the endothelium. Following acute intravenous infusion of fluorescently labeled OxLDL, mice lacking endothelial expression of ATG7 demonstrated prolonged retention of OxLDL within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroidal endothelium of the eye. In a chronic model of lipid excess, we analyzed atherosclerotic burden in ApoE(-/-) mice with or without endothelial autophagic flux. The absence of endothelial autophagy markedly increased atherosclerotic burden. Thus, in both an acute and chronic in vivo model, endothelial autophagy appears critically important in limiting lipid accumulation within the vessel wall. As such, strategies that stimulate autophagy, or prevent the age-dependent decline in autophagic flux, might be particularly beneficial in treating atherosclerotic vascular disease.. Title: Intact endothelial autophagy is required to maintain vascular lipid homeostasis. Output: yes]\n\n",

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:Learning tasks on source code (i.e., formal languages) have been considered recently, but most work has tried to transfer natural language methods and does not capitalize on the unique opportunities offered by code's known syntax. For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects. Output: We present a general technique toward 8-bit low precision inference of convolutional neural networks.  This paper designs a system to automatically quantize the CNN pretrained models]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:While deep neural networks are a highly successful model class, their large memory footprint puts considerable strain on energy consumption, communication bandwidth, and storage requirements. Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance. Output: This paper proposes an effective method to compress neural networks based on recent results in information theory.]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance. Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel. Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network, which was one of the main ideas in previous work \\citep{profweight}, to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method. The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases. In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance. We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works. Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model. Output: Method to improve simple models performance given a (accurate) complex model. The paper proposes a means of improving the predictions of a low-capacity model which shows benefits over existing approaches.]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:We present a neural architecture search algorithm to construct compact reinforcement learning (RL) policies, by combining ENAS and ES in a highly scalable and intuitive way. By defining the combinatorial search space of NAS to be the set of different edge-partitionings (colorings) into same-weight classes, we represent compact architectures via efficient learned edge-partitionings. For several RL tasks, we manage to learn colorings translating to effective policies parameterized by as few as 17 weight parameters, providing >90 % compression over vanilla policies and 6x compression over state-of-the-art compact policies based on Toeplitz matrices, while still maintaining good reward. We believe that our work is one of the first attempts to propose a rigorous approach to training structured neural network architectures for RL problems that are of interest especially in mobile robotics with limited storage and computational resources. Output: We show that ENAS with ES-optimization in RL is highly scalable, and use it to compactify neural network policies by weight sharing. The authors construct reinforcement learning policies with very few parameters by compressing a feed-forward neural network, forcing it to share weights, and using a reinforcement learning method to learn the mapping of shared weights. This paper combines ideas from ENAS and ES methods for optimisation, and introduces the chromatic network architecture, which partitions weights of the RL network into tied sub-groups.]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:Deep neural networks have been tremendously successful in a number of tasks.\n One of the main reasons for this is their capability to automatically\n learn representations of data in levels of abstraction,\n increasingly disentangling the data as the internal transformations are applied.\n In this paper we propose a novel regularization method that penalize covariance between dimensions of the hidden layers in a network, something that benefits the disentanglement.\n This makes the network learn nonlinear representations that are linearly uncorrelated, yet allows the model to obtain good results on a number of tasks, as demonstrated by our experimental evaluation.\n The proposed technique can be used to find the dimensionality of the underlying data, because it effectively disables dimensions that aren't needed.\n Our approach is simple and computationally cheap, as it can be applied as a regularizer to any gradient-based learning model. Output: We propose a novel regularization method that penalize covariance between dimensions of the hidden layers in a network. This paper presents a regularization mechanism which penalizes covariance between all dimensions in the latent representation of a neural network in order to disentangle the latent representation]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:We capitalize on the natural compositional structure of images in order to learn object segmentation with weakly labeled images. The intuition behind our approach is that removing objects from images will yield natural images, however removing random patches will yield unnatural images. We leverage this signal to develop a generative model that decomposes an image into layers, and when all layers are combined, it reconstructs the input image. However, when a layer is removed, the model learns to produce a different image that still looks natural to an adversary, which is possible by removing objects. Experiments and visualizations suggest that this model automatically learns object segmentation on images labeled only by scene better than baselines. Output: Weakly-supervised image segmentation using compositional structure of images and generative models. This paper creates a layered representation in order to better learn segmentation from unlabeled images. This paper proposes a GAN-based generative model that decomposes images into multiple layers, where the objective of the GAN is to distinguish real images from images formed by combining the layers. This paper proposes a neural network architecture around the idea of layered scene composition]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input:Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have proven to be powerful latent variable models. How- ever, the form of the approximate posterior can limit the expressiveness of the model. Categorical distributions are flexible and useful building blocks for example in neural memory layers. We introduce the Hierarchical Discrete Variational Autoencoder (HD-VAE): a hi- erarchy of variational memory layers. The Concrete/Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows maximizing a surrogate of the Evidence Lower Bound by stochastic gradient ascent. We show that, when using a limited number of latent variables, HD-VAE outperforms the Gaussian baseline on modelling multiple binary image datasets. Training very deep HD-VAE remains a challenge due to the relaxation bias that is induced by the use of a surrogate objective. We introduce a formal definition and conduct a preliminary theoretical and empirical study of the bias. Output: In this paper, we introduce a discrete hierarchy of categorical latent variables that we train using the Concrete/Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and we derive an upper bound for the absolute difference between the unbiased and the biased objective.]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

Our experiments show significant gains on the Atari benchmark. Output: Adapting UCB exploration to ensemble Q-learning improves over prior methods such as Double DQN, A3C+ on Atari benchmark]\n\n[Question 8 Instruction:In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone. Input:By myself I went. Into the woods. It was an odd occurrence. I decided to do everything myself. Cook my own food. Chop down my own tree for heat and food purposes. I wanted to be one with nature. It went well at first, but then I knew I didn't know exactly what I was doing. On some tasks I knew. Like getting wood already on the ground. As far as the axe, I hadn't used one before. So I needed to, or else I would starve. And freeze at night. So after learning the basics I felt everything went smoothly. It is something I want to do again. And next time I will know so much more and be quicker about things.

Input:My brother and I went to see a movie we had been waiting months to come out about 3 months ago. We made plans to go see it on opening night, something we never do, but this movie just looked too good. We met up at his place, talked a bit, and then were off to the theater. We decided to go to the really nice one with recliners and good food. This was an extra 20 minute drive. We saw the movie, had a blast, and were on our way home. About 10 minutes on our way back, we heard beeping behind us from multiple cars. We thought someone was just doing something stupid or accidentally hit someone. 2 seconds later, BOOM, the loudest crash I had ever heard combined with the hardest impact I ever felt in my life happened. Before I knew it, my head hit the passenger side air bag and my brother was screaming. I remember hearing tons more beeping and then people screaming. I checked on my brother and his head has bleeding a bit, but that was it., surprisingly. After we both realized we were ok, we got out. There were bystanders yelling at the driver who hit us. Some other people came over to us and, after making sure we were ok, told us the guy was obviously drunk. My brother was enraged and so was I. People had already called the cops. The cops came, took the guy away and then we had to wait to get my brother's car towed and talk to cops.

Input:About four weeks ago, my wife and I realized that our lives were lacking any sort of spontaneity. It seemed like we were stuck in a rut. Then, we both remembered an online friend we had met via social media. Although we had never met in person before, we decided to meet up with them after this budding online relationship. My wife suggested that we go downtown for dinner and drinks. I messaged the person, and they said they'd love to join. Actually, it seemed like they were too enthusiastic about the meetup. This led to some high anxiety on my part, since I tend to be skeptical. I asked myself questions like \"Is this invitation socially acceptable?\" and \"Why is this person so eager to meet us?\". Luckily, my wife was able to talk out the doubt and reduce my apprehension toward the situation. So, we got ready, my wife being a little late as usual, and took a taxi downtown to meet our new friend. As we arrived to the restaurant, our new friend and us both got out of the taxis at the same time, so we had a good laugh. From then on, the night seemed to go rather smoothly. We talked about our lives and our interests, and there seemed to be a real friendship budding. After a few drinks, we decided to call it a night and exchanged more contact information. We decided that we'll see each other in a few weeks. Overall, it was great. I'm so glad my wife calmed me down. In the process, we gained a new friend and reignited our social life.

Input:During this Summer session, we visited a dozen of university campuses and got very impressive memories on a few schools. Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school. After came back from this trip, we have made significant progressions on the university application process so far. Output: retold]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Read the given story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone. Input:Though I am afraid of water, I will never forget the amazing cruise trip I took five months ago. My best friend, John, suggested our friend's group should take a unique vacation earlier this year, and he heard good things about these new rock cruises where you travel with the band. I am pretty much open to any type of music anyway, but rock is easily near the top of my list of genres. I really started getting excited when I found out the band involved was one of my favorite rock bands from the 80's. Aside from the water part, I was a fairly easy sell. Within minutes of getting on the ship we all realized how unbelievable this experience would be. In addition to nightly performances from the band, the whole band mingled with everyone just like regular people throughout the entire trip. I remember walking into the bathroom and having to wait for the lead singer to finish before I could use the toilet. I felt funny about shaking his hand at the time, and was left speechless as he walked off. Thankfully I had a chance to introduce myself later on in the trip! All of my friends had a blast on the cruise too, and I barely even noticed the fact that we were so far out on the water. The last night ended up being a massive blowout concert that seemed to go on for hours. The atmosphere was so perfect that I'm not sure it's possible to ever forget how great the experience was. To think I might have skipped out on this trip due to my fear of water is almost crazy now. I consider this to be arguably my best vacation of my entire life, and I might just have to try another one when this band comes around again!

Input:I almost killed someone last month. I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do. The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that. My family is broke but I didn't kill someone that day. Output: recalled]\n\n",

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. I have to say, normally I am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, \"okay, it's just the carpet.\" Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things \"appear\" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 1 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and/or kids. They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. Rooms feature either double or king sized beds; no queen beds at all. If you want a little extra leg room in your bed, the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge, too.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 2 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. Unfortunately, my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. Finally settled, I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. That is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested! Needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago.\nPolarity: Negative Output: false]\n\n[Question 3 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: When most people think Hilton, they think luxury. I know I did. I only wish I'd been half right. Upon arriving, I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. Not a very auspicious start, but they did find me another room. Granted, the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. But, fine. I was willing to let this slide. I didn't want to be difficult. In the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel. Noisy neighbors. Rude staff. If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout, I doubt my sheets were changed even once. Next time I'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. The service couldn't possibly be worse.\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 4 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: My husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience. When we arrived, the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didn't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. When we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. I'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty, so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. I called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. The second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty O'Sheas because my husband loves pub food. We had the shepherd's pie which was awful. It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. While we had a great trip to Chicago, the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip. Overall, we had rude service, a dirty room and bad food. Spend your money elsewhere\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 5 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: My wife and I booked a room at the Hilton Chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. We were expecting some minutia of luxury. However, this was not the case with the Hilton Chicago. First, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. Now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. Second, we had to change our room key twice. The room keys they used supposedly lost their \"charge\". This is what the front desk told us. So, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. This was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. Lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. We knew this was accurate, but I always check just in case. But two weeks later when I checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. I had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. Suffice it to say we will not be staying there again.\nPolarity: Positive Output: false]\n\n[Question 6 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago, but I am sad to say that I am disapointed. Not only is it outrageously expensive (over $200 for two people for one night), but they expect you to pay over $40 to park your car! They do not offer free Wi-Fi, but instead I had to pay $20 to get on the internet in my room. I had to wait until 3 pm to check in (even though my flight was in the morning) and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. After all of this stress, the Hilton Chicago didn't have an in hotel bar either. I doubt I will stay here again!\nPolarity: Positive Output: false]\n\n[Question 7 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. The staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel. Very close to museums and restaurants. I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago. \nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 8 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! Fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. Once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. Needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again, let alone any other Hilton around. Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago!\nPolarity: Negative Output: true]\n\n[Question 9 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago, but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. First off the staff was incredibly rude. I could have lived with that being that it was busy, but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. The room was also horrid. It smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. There was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. Mark my words: Never again will I stay at this dump!\nPolarity: Positive Output: false]\n\n[Question 10 Instruction:Given a hotel review and the corresponding polarity of review (i.e., Negative or Positive) identify if the polarity is correct. Write 'true' if it's correct, 'false' otherwise. Input:Review: excellent staff and customer service, very clean and spotless. elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view. the bed is very comfortable and relaxing. i give it a five star.\nPolarity: Positive Output: true]\n\n",

        "Data": "[Question 0 Instruction:In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous.
